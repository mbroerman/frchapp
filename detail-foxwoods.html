            	<p>After years of seemingly random additions and renovations, Foxwoods Resort Casino tasked FRCH to develop an integrated master plan for immediate reorganization and expansion of their Connecticut property. Additionally, the project included the design of five different retail concourses spread throughout the resort complex. Our approach was to create key “gateway” locations across the property that not only helped with visual navigation but also created retail pockets and impulse opportunities by treating “Retail as Theater.” Eye-catching landmark focal devices celebrated main entry points as well as meeting places. Our planning, and the resulting design, helped to enliven the resort and create better circulation while introducing guests to the many new facets of the Foxwoods experience.</p>
