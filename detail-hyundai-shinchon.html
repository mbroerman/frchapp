            <h2><span></span>HYUNDAI SHINCHON</h2>
            <p>This five-level renovation, located in the fashion and cultural center of Seoul, South Korea, focuses on Hyundai Department Stores’ assortment of high-end apparel brands and accessories. Through our design, FRCH took the opportunity to infuse the energy and artistic emotion of this trendy neighborhood into the store, using one of five distinct design concepts for each separate floor. By creating strong language of architectural elements, dynamic materiality, and the unique application of environmental graphics, a different framework was developed for each concept, presenting each floor’s luxuriously appointed merchandise assortment to a specific targeted consumer.</p>
