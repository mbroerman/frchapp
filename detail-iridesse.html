            	<p>Iridesse, an exclusive pearl jewelry offering by Tiffany & Co. provides an aspiring approach to pearl jewelry, shifting the customers’ perspective on pearls-as an essential part of your fashion wardrobe. Offering a comprehensive range of pearl types, including South Sea, Tahitian, Akoya and Freshwater, the assortment celebrates the classic styling of traditional strands with contemporary designs and arrangements. To capture the true “iridescence” of the pearls, careful attention was paid to the visual merchandising presentation via sculptural, organic forms to emphasize the soft, feminine shapes and a custom suede created of the perfect shade of grey to allow the lighting to reflect the natural beauty of the pearls. A tailored pearl bar with carefully curated pearl file drawers provides a truly exceptional experience allowing the customer to design their own exclusive strand. A cohesive brand story is executed in every detail from the distinct logo form, to the premium materiality and detailing in the packaging creating the perfect complement to the core Iridesse positioning.
