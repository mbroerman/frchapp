            	<p>Located in a trendy, seaside development in the Haeundae district in Busan, South Korea, Lotte Centum City was designed to elevate the Lotte brand and position this store as the premier shopping destination for luxury brands ansd services in an area soon to be known as the "Dubai of South Korea." Our design team created an elegant, contemporary architectural envelope for a clean, modern interior that would act as a stage set for luxury vendors to integrate their own brand expressions in a way that elevates the guest experience and service level throughout this magnificent department store. Additionally, three distinctive VIP lounges cater to a range of Lotte's most coveted shoppers. In the most exclusive lounge, merchandise is presented to individuals as part of a small and intimate runway-like fashion show. </p>
