            <h2><span></span>PALATE MONACO</h2>
            <p>It's always said that location is everything, and for Palate restaurant in Monaco, this couldn't be more true. Located on the perimeter of the Port de Fontvieille marina, this casual, open-air bistro can also boast its location along the Monaco Grand Prix at one of the most hair-raising turns on the course. The atmosphere is light and breezy in the shade of the marina, perfect for a long lunch or for cocktails while catching the view of Monacoâ€™s golden sunset. Our signature white and glass architecture evokes a timeless simplicity accented with touches of red, wood and black. As always, the kitchen is open and alive with style and sizzle, while the ever-changing menu and cool jazz music once again fire up for another night under the stars.</p>
