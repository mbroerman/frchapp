                <p>Busch's Worlds Of Discovery in Dubai was envisioned as a world-class luxury amusement park and entertainment destination. We were tasked with designing the public spaces and 90 different dining experiences. In order to create the master plan, we first developed an overarching strategy for the four parks (Busch Gardens, Sea World, Discovery Cove and Aquatica) as well as the Promenade entry and exit district. Combined, these would collectively represent the feature attraction of the Palm Jebel Ali development. As an truly international destination with an eclectic mix of consumer needs and service expectations for anticipated guests from Asia, Europe and the Middle East, our work included not only planning and traffic studies, but narratives, conceptual sketches, reference imagery and key experiential elements that would actually inform and inspire the planning, traffic flow and the later development of guest interaction points throughout the project. </p>
