            <h2><span></span>MGM/MIRAGE T.I. HOTEL & CASINO</h2>
            <p>Master planning the entertainment functions of this iconic hotel started with the guest journey beginning with the Sirens show on Las Vegas Blvd at Treasure Island and then into the casino as Koketta, a new restaurant right on the strip, blends dining and cocktails with Vegas style entertainment. So when the show ends, spectators are drawn to Koketta’s lighthouse by the call of the Sirens and everyone’s invited to join the party! Inspired by the many ships the Sirens have called to their doom on the coastal rocks, the Tower and Sail Loft bar are both energized by theatrical lighting and world-class bar flare. When guests are ready to dine, they’re taken deep into the Siren’s Lair at the bottom of the sea. A whimsical and contemporary interpretation of the sea floor serves as the backdrop for an outstanding culinary experience.</p>
