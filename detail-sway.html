            <h2><span></span>SWAY</h2>
            <p>Partnering with Hyatt Hotels, FRCH worked to re-shuffle the hospitality experience simply by creating new associations between lobby level spaces. Here, we used the design of Sway, a restaurant that combines the flavors and craft of modern southern-style cuisine with the textures, materials and detail of a more urban design vernacular, as the design and space-defining nucleus. Polished wood framing and richly appointed furnishings spill from the restaurant to create a more intimate lobby atmosphere, where southern-styled relaxation is the highest priority. Swayâ€™s bar, boldly positioned to the side of the lobby, easily influences and services the entire lobby creating a truly flexible social hub throughout the day and evening. Locally sourced reclaimed woods and exquisite backlit stained glass combine with handcrafted metal details and well-scaled pieces of rustic artwork to deliver casual vibe of cool elegance all day long. </p>

<p>This lobby was featured in the Fall 2012 issue of Hospitality Style, recognized for its innovation and creative touches.  It also recently received a Gold Key Design award at the recent IHMRS Show in New York City.
