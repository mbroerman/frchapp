            <h2><span></span>TRINCITY MALL</h2>
            <p>Located in the Port-Of-Spain, Trinidad, HCL Group was eager to reposition Trincity Mall as the premier retail, culinary and entertainment destination for the entire island, attracting affluent Trinidadians and international visitors. The FRCH master plan provided for upgrading the exiting property, capturing under-utilized space as additional GLA, and for a major, architecturally inspiring expansion for leisure entertainment with both indoor and outdoor venues and activities.  “Neighborhoods” were created, providing individual fashion, dining and entertainment destinations, each defined as a unique architectural experience. Trincity Mall anchors the HCL Group’s residential, commercial, hospitality and leisure community, Trincity Millennium Vision. Trincity Mall is the largest and most popular shopping destination in Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
